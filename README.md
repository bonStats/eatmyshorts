The first occurence of the famous "eat my shorts" catch phrase was in S01E02 of The Simpsons. It is the episode where Bart is told by Edna Krabappel to "visualise the problem" when Bart is having problems with a aptitude test. This clip from the episode summarises how I sometimes feel about visualising BART models [https://youtu.be/6Jq_9ghf-jI](https://youtu.be/6Jq_9ghf-jI).
